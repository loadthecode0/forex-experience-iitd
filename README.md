# Student Exchange Experience from IITD
A brief FAQ summary of my Foreign Exchange experience from IITD, and pointers for potential exchangees.

_**If any questions remain unanswered, create an issue in the Issues tab.**_

## About me 
- CS1 class of 2026.
- Semester exchangee at DTU (Denmark Technical University) during Fall semester, 2024 (Semester I, 2024-25 at IITD).

## Eligibility and Application Process

- As of 2024-25, applications are invited at the end of the second year of study, to exchange for any semester of the third year, for both B. Tech and Dual degree students.
- There are 2 rounds of selection:
  - **Round I: Applications:**
    - Eligibility: CGPA $\geq$ 8.00
    - Students have to apply on e-Academics s-portal, where they are asked for different achievements and an SOP.
    - This is a pretty chill round, >100 students are selected generally.
  - **Round II: Written Exam:**
    - Written exam with General Knowledge-related MCQs and Essays.
    - Not super eliminative, ~80 students selected.
- A rank list is released, and a Google form is floated for students to fill their preferred host universities.
- Host universities are allotted based on rank, i.e, a person with a smaller rank gets priority of preference.

- Selected students can look at the [rank list](rank_list.pdf) and [final allotment list](final_allotment.pdf) from my year to get an idea of rank-uni mapping.

## Factors to consider while selecting host university:
- Courses offered, and potential disruptions in your degree planning
- Accomodation, Food facilities, Transportation inside the country.
- Finances
- Desired potential travel experiences
- Dietary and cultural restrictions, if any

### Course Planning
- In your host uni, you need to look for courses which would get approved for equivalence at IITD (significant overlap required).
- Your host uni should have a public course-base for this purpose.
- Then approach institute authorities to get guidance and final approval on these courses.
- There are 3 (in my knowledge) modes of getting your **_departmental courses_** approved:
  - _DUGC_ (not in all departments) - Approach in person/mail
  - _Department's Forex Advisor_ (not in all department) - Approach in person/mail
  - _Coursewise Faculty_ - Mail the faculty concerning every course
- You have to mail faculties separately if you want approval for **_HUL courses_**.
- If you are not able to find perfectly mapped courses, you could ask for approval of courses under 'Special Topics'.
- Core courses are difficult to get passed (generally), so an ideal strategy would be to go for DEs and HULs.

### Accomodation
- Look for host uni-provided accomodation.
- You can also look for sublets on Facebook and common uni groups.
- Another option is talking to people you know, who are moving out, for future subletting.

### Finances
- Expect an average expenditure of INR 6-7L.
- Apply for scholarships/financial assistance if applicable.

### Miscellaneous
- Ensure timely processing of Visa and/or Passport.
- Look at transportation arrangements.
- Make travel plans somewhat prior to travel, to get cheap prices.
- Look at the cooking/eating arrangements beforehand.
- Make a packing list.
   
## Financial Details
- Students are expected to bear travel and lodging expenses themselves.
- Some host institutions may provide partial financial assistance (varies greatly).
- Tuition and boarding fees (if keeping hostel room) are to be paid at IITD. Tuition Fee is waived off at host institution.
